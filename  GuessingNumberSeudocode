 
declare secretNumber variable

declare guessNumber that holds the users guess

Create Random class object to generate random numbers from 1 to 10.

 Generate random numbers ranging from 1 to 10(secretNumber=1 + rand.nextInt(10))

 Prompt the user to enter the guess number

get the guess number

while the guesNumber != secretNumber loop through
  if guessNumber > secretNumber
       tell user it is too high.
 else 
   tell the user it is too low.
when guessNumber == secretNumber , tell the user he the secret number is found.
